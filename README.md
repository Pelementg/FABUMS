# FABUMS - Mindastry
Does programming in Mindastry seem too complicated? Tired of managing each unit individually? Do you want the waves to destroy themselves? Your decision:
FABUMS - Fully Automatic Base and Unit Management System.

Our system will allow you to manage energy, units, and resource extraction completely automatically! Just set the necessary values in the first processor variables and they will do everything for you! Units restore buildings, extract resources, repair structures, attack the enemy, and a convenient system for monitoring and displaying information will help you react in case of an unforeseen situation!

All the settings for unit management are signed so that you can easily understand the management.

It is also possible to connect an accelerator (dome1). If you are installing an accelerator, connect it to the regenerator control processor to add it to the auto-shutdown system.
